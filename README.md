This is a game made for CPS375 (Computer Networking) in which the player 
must blindly (not knowing current position percisely) move around the 
map searching for acorn rewards.

To Use:
Python 3.1 required.

Start the server with the following command:
    python AcornServer.py

Run the client with:
    python AcornClient.py


To Play:
Assuming that the client actually connects with the server, the client 
will pop up a prompt: ">>> ". Here the user is to type the following:

"w" for going up
"s" for going down
"a" for going left
"d" for going right

There is no indicator as to where the player is starting.

Good luck!
